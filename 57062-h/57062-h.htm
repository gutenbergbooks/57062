<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Oh, for a modern James Whitcomb Riley! Could
the incomparable Hoosier poet be with us today,
what a masterpiece he could make out of the
ordinary news of the day. With such material at hand
as this from the columns of the Chicago Herald-Examiner,
he could bring tears to the eyes of those with
fond reminiscences. Under a heading, “LAST ONE
IN CHICAGO DESTROYED BY FIRE,” the newspaper
states:</p>

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p>The last one in Chicago burned down last night.
The fire engine got around to the back yard of
1102 Hastings st., too late.</p>

</div>

<p>Truly, brevity is the soul of wit!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">A news article in the daily papers say a Chicago
woman has filed suit against her husband on the
ground that he refused to pare her toe nails, and
the husband comes back with the counter-charge that
she smeared her face with cold cream to such an extent
that he’d get it tangled up in his hair during the night.</p>

<p>To our mind, this suit opens up some wonderful
possibilities, especially, as Mr. Stillman would say,
when the supply of Indian guides gives out. Supposing,
as our London co-scribe says, a woman wedded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a highlander discovered after the nuptials that her
husband refused to shave the hair off his calves, might
she not be able to file her divorce with reasonable hope
of success?</p>

<p>Again, we have the man who, when taking a bath,
within earshot of his wife’s bedroom, insists on singing
unbearable songs of the type the Yanks sang in
France—</p>

<p>“She’s Mademoiselle from Armentieres, who
hasn’t been kissed for forty years. Hinky Pinky
Parley Vouz.”</p>

<p>Surely a Chicago court would grant her a split
from her spouse. And a husband who would bite his
wife’s mole also might be in danger of being divorced
by a woman who believed she was entitled to a less
emotional husband.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Twice, by urgent requests from ardent defenders
of the fair sex, Whiz Bang has reproduced “The
pedigreed Persian Cat” from its issue of May,
last year. You’ll remember it—the story prose of the
perfumed kitty who wandered out the back door for
air and was lured away by an alley tom cat, and who,
upon her return later, told her kittens their Pa was a
traveling man.</p>

<p>We’ve been waiting patiently for some traveling
man to register his protest and step up with straight
dope to refute intimation that a feline member of the
fraternity enticed the perfumed pussy over the primrose
path. And now we have it—a poem in answer,
from the pen of one who signs “Josh M. Allong.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I resent the intimation that a member of my profession
was to blame,” he writes. “The original poem
is propaganda to whitewash the reputation of a loose
and unprincipled female, even if she is only a cat.
Therefore, I am writing the following true version.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>This Persian Kitty, perfumed and fair,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Did not go out on the porch for air,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>But she saw that tom cat taking a stroll</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And she laid a plan to get his roll.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>For she saw that he was a country swell</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Who would fall for any tale she’d tell,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And, while acting so sweet and innocent,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>She was full of guile and devilment.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Then she led him along to a quiet spot</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Where they bring it along at a dollar a “Bot”</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And, while he spent his hard earned tin,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>She stole his watch and his diamond pin.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>And, when she had him as clean as a bone,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sneaked off with her lover and left him alone,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Hungry and footsore, to trod the way</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Back to the farm and the new mown hay.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>After reading the accounts in the Saturday Blade
of the Stillman divorce case, our hired man, Gus, asks
me if he can have the job as “Indian” guide at my
Pequot, Minnesota, cabin resort this summer and fall.
Gus, however, is doomed to disappointment, because I
have engaged a real half breed Indian for the job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Although, as Gus, our hired man, says, Deacon
Miller, my neighbor, doesn’t like my Whiz Bang
and claims he tears it up outside his door and
lets the wind scatter the pieces of paper all over his
wheat field, we’ll have to give the Deacon credit for
rearing a bunch of ladylike cows. One of the Deacon’s
bossies broke through the barbed-wire fence which
separates his pasture from mine, while I was at Pequot.
The cow unceremoniously walked into my house
through the open door, looked at the pictures on the
wall and then walked up to the mirror to see if her
horns were on straight.</p>

<p>Not finding anyone at home, the cow, as is the custom,
left her card and departed.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p>Johnny Beaton, noted Minnesota Bohemian, told a
rather good story the other day while he and I were
shopping for schnapps in Minneapolis. During the
inspection of our purchases, Johnny, who hails from
Ranier, Minn., on the Canadian boundary, said he had
recently engaged in a rip-roaring poker game. In this
game were two Englishmen from the Canuck side of
the line. The Englishmen always referred to a five-dollar
bill as “a pound.” “I’ll raise you two pounds,”
said the first Englishman. “I’ll make it five bloody
more pounds,” replied the second. About this time a
local bootlegger, who had been testing his own product,
blurted out as he pushed in his wad of money in the
center of the table: “I’ll raise you three tons.” The
bootlegger hauled in the pot.</p>

<h2><i>Our Movie Gossips</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Elinor Glyn is pursued by the ghost of “Three
Weeks” and the gossips are trying to catch her flirting!
Mary and Doug aid Bennie Ziedman in courtship
for Marjorie Daw! Rudolph Valentino turns the
tables of his separation-wife, Jane Acker! Bill Hart
and Jane Novak may get married and live in Spanish
“duplex”! My, my, what morsels of gossip we hear
from our bevy of Hollywood and Los Angeles correspondents!</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Pity Poor Elinor Glyn! Screen folk, suspicious
because England’s titian-haired authoress wrote
“Three Weeks,” are reported sleuthing around
the Los Angeles hotels and cafes and the Lasky studio,
trying to catch Mrs. Glyn flirting! Leastwise, the gossips
are busy, and the dainty morsel upon which they
are chewing is none other than Mrs. Glyn’s purported
fondness for dancing.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mrs. Glyn?” they ask around the Lasky
studio.</p>

<p>“Oh, somewhere dancing, I suppose,” comes a
reply in much the same tone as was used during the
war when the ladies danced while friend husband
dodged Whiz Bangs in France.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glyn’s famous novel, “Three Weeks,” might
have been her worst personal faux pas. At the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Navy ball in the Ambassador hotel, she remained for
the most part of the evening on the balcony overlooking
the ball-room floor, accompanied by one of her
youthful actor admirers, and as her gaze passed over
the heads of mere ensigns, four-stripers looked up, but
feared to tread, maybe. At least, Mrs. Glyn did not
dance with many, according to the correspondent of
this great family journal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Glyn is writing a new story for the Lasky
company. Of course the Lasky people aren’t telling
around just yet what the story is to be about, but the
gossips whisper that it’s to be like this:</p>

<p>A girl, born of a Russian dancer mother, and a staid
American father, grows up into a beautiful woman.
However, everyone who knew of her mother’s wild,
wild life, fear the girl will develop into the same sort of
female. But she never does, until, way out west, she is
bitten by a snake. Then she becomes so, so wild! Just
what form her wildness takes, has not yet been ascertained.
At any rate, the hero is right there at the climax
wishing she wasn’t wild (?) so he heroically sucks
the poison from her wound and quiets her nerves again!
It’s called “The Great Moment.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">It seems that since “Mary” and “Doug.” have been
married, they have turned into regular old match-makers.
They are working on all their friends. Can
it be they are just now concentrating on sweet, blonde
Marjorie Daw, who is one of Mary Pickford’s most
intimate friends?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcel De Sano, the dark, handsome and entirely
morose Universal director is believed infatuated with
the fair Marjorie just now. He recently attended an
informal little house dance in Hollywood and lurked
in a shadowy corner all evening because Marjorie was
not with him. Mary and Doug. are quietly and intensively
working overtime to interest Marjorie in Bennie
Ziedman, business manager for “Doug.” Now, Bennie
is entirely cheerful, he’s a nice unaffected little chap
whom everyone likes and they say Doug. pays him some
fat salary! Bennie hasn’t his supposed rival’s mysterious
South-of-Europe eyes and hair, but he’s an enterprising,
live-wire Yankee. Now, Mary and Doug. are
a couple of sly, old match-makers. Maybe they know
they will spoil everything if they urge Marjorie to
choose Bennie, or if they knock any of her other suitors,
so they adroitly throw Bennie and Marjorie
together on many occasions. Whether Bennie and
Marjorie are aware of this or not is a mystery.</p>

<p>Quite recently, Doug. was frightfully interested in
purchasing a home at Santa Barbara. Of course, it
being a business matter, Ziedman, the business manager,
must needs go along to inspect the property. I
think they even kidded several hopeful real estate dealers
into believing that Mr. Fairbanks was really intending
removing his famous family to Santa Barbara. At
any rate, it made it possible for them to take Marjorie
and Bennie to Santa Barbara for a week-end trip and
throw them together for three complete days.</p>

<p>Nothing has developed yet, but all know Bennie’s
blush and his chronic suffering from shyness. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he hasn’t yet roused his courage, or is handsome De
Sano getting in his quiet, intense deep stuff? All
Hollywood wonders!</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Rudolph Valentino, the handsome young
Italian actor who plays the lead in “The Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse,” is the husband of
Jane Acker, who also plays leads in pictures. Valentino,
it will be remembered, once was Joan Sawyer’s
dancing partner in vaudeville.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, the Valentino family separated
about a year ago. For a time, Rudolph was heartbroken
over the separation and urged his mutual
friends to help him make up the difference. Just then,
Jane had offers galore from film companies and she was
believed upstage and independent, and to have refused
to consider Valentino for a second session. Now,
lately, the tables have turned. Valentino has made a
great hit in the Metro photoplay taken from the biggest
seller of last year. He can just about command his
own salary in filmdom from now on. And, wife Janie
hasn’t had such an easy winner. With dozens of companies
ceasing to produce, offers haven’t come bounding
in at an alarming rate. Or perhaps Jane didn’t
know husband was such a capable actor and could make
such a hit? Can it be she at last realizes what a precious
jewel she has lost, and that now it is Jane’s turn
to hope they make up, and Valentino’s to assert manly
indifference toward the fair sex entirely? Hollywood
wonders how it will come out.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Close friends of Bill Hart say he is to marry beautiful
Jane Novak, who has played so many leads
in Hart pictures. All the evidence seems to point
that way. Bill declared through the press that April
2 last, was his final day in motion pictures.</p>

<p>Jane will receive her final decree of divorce within
a few weeks now. Bill is building on to his lovely home
in Hacienda Park. The Spanish mansion now is
divided into two sections with a long roofed corridor
running between. The new wing of rooms has lately
been added to the lovely mansion. Is Bill going to be a
truly modern husband and keep his own sanctum sanctorum
at one end of the mansion for himself and allow
his wife to have a number of rooms in which she, of her
own free will, may roam as she pleases? Most wives
would never be bored with the sort of Bill who planned
his romantic nest with such nicety!</p>

other red-blooded poems will appear in the Winter

of 1921-22,” which will be published in October.
This year, Whiz Bang’s greatest entertainer will
appear four times the regular monthly’s size, and will
contain, for the most part, brand-new stuff, but for the
benefit of new readers, stories and verse from early
issues will be reprinted. Only four months to wait!
Don’t write for last year’s Annual! It was sold out
within thirty days!</p>

<h3>A Short Story</h3>

<p>His young wife laughed till she creaked as he
slowly drank his iced tea.</p>

<p>“You are laughing,” he said, wiping his well-formed
lips with the hem of the tablecloth. “Why?”</p>

<p>“I just happened to remember,” she said between
gasps, “that I put the cyanide of potassium in the iced
tea instead of the rat trap!”</p>

<p>It was too droll. He laughed heartily as he slid
under the table.</p>

<h3>Men</h3>

<p>Men are what women marry. They have two feet,
two hands, and sometimes two wives, but never more
than one collar button, or one idea at a time.</p>

<p>Like Turkish cigarettes, men are all made of the
same material, the only difference being that some are
a little better distinguished than others.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, they may be divided into three
classes, husbands, bachelors, and widowers. Bachelors
are a commodity, husbands a necessity, and widowers
a luxury, especially when making love.</p>

<p>Girls, you can always tell if a man really loves
you. If he says, “I love you,” and drawls it out as if
it hurt him, he’s silver plated goods. If he says it as if
he were ordering a glass of beer, that shows he is sizing
up your dad’s pocket book, but if he says “I love you,”
and hugs as if he’d never let go, and flushes up like a

<h2><i>Havana’s Passe Charms</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The author of this story, a Minneapolis preacher,
recently returned from a tour of the West Indies for
the Whiz Bang, and in this writing he depicts the gay
carnival spirit which reigns in Havana because of
America’s prohibition.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. “GOLIGHTLY” MORRILL</p>

<p class="center sans">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Many are the travelers, like Pantagruel, in search
of the <i>Dive Bouteille</i>—Holy Bottle, and who
believe in its oracular utterance—“Drink!”
The man who holds in veneration the memory of Noah,
notices on entering Havana that the harbor entrance
is “bottle-necked,” and well “fortified”—with booze.
The “Fountain of Youth” here is not water, but
“cask”ades of wine and beer, etc. However, one needs
the purse of Croesus, for if you want to drink you must
pay what the bar wants to charge—a price as exorbitant
as smuggled liquor brings in the States. If you
remonstrate with the bartender, you may send for the
manager, as my friend did, and have him say, “Don’t
bother me—tell your troubles to a policeman.” If you
are mad and tired of Cuba, go to Guadeloupe and Martinique
in the French West Indies where the rent-hog
is unknown; where a good room rents for $7 a month;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
where a course dinner, with a bottle of wine, at the
best hotel will cost you only 40 cents; where rum punch
is three cents a glass, wine five cents, and the best
brands of champagne, $1.50 to $2.00 a quart. In Cuba
you pay $2.50 for a bottle of wine, and $12 for a quart
of champagne.</p>

<p>Pascal wrote that man was the “glory and scum
of the universe.” Much of the scum of the United
States has floated to Havana. The lure of “spiritual”
elixirs (there is a vermouth in town known as “Vaticano”)
has brought a “bum” element to the island.
Havana has become a convention city for crooks who
frequent the race-track, saloons and gambling hells.
Most appropriately has the outline of Cuba been compared
to the hammer-headed shark. Fights and brawls
are common; city jails are full of American drunks and
toughs. Cuba has imported laborers from Haiti to
raise cane, but the worst “Cain-raisers” have come
from the United States. Sterne said, “An Englishman
does not travel to see Englishmen”—an American
does not care to journey here to meet such Americans.</p>

<p>The tourist, robbed right and left, need have little
fear of the Havana señorita stealing away his heart.
Her beauty is largely mythical. As a rule, the Cuban
woman looks as if she had used a barrel of flour to
powder her face, and her body is built on barrel-hoop
lines. To powder she adds paint—mamma and her
daughters are about the only paintings one finds in
town. After viewing and reviewing these Spanish
“beauties” (so inferior to our American beauties in
the garden of love), one does not feel inclined to purchase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the books sold here in the stores: “The Art
of Kissing in Twelve Lessons”; “The Art of Caressing
in Twelve Lessons.” Taken all in all, the Havana
“angel” is an adorable, endurable inutility—an expensive
luxury on which to hang fine clothes and diamonds.
Pythagoras made it a rule to review every
night what he had done during the day. Were she
to follow his example, I fear she would soon be
through, for she appears to be master of the art of
doing nothing that is important.</p>

<p>Havana harbors many “ladies” of that species
one calls ladies only between quotation marks. God
made Cuba, but the Devil invented some of Havana’s
pastimes. The Cuban is “revolting” in his pleasures
as well as in his politics. Streets along the water-front
are lined by open bars and brothels brilliantly lighted—a
mistake, because most of the inmates resemble
female Calibans.</p>

<p>The witchery of the old time wanton is no more.
With Flaubert one laments the passing of the <i>fille de
joie</i>: “In olden times she was beautiful when she
walked up the steps leading to the temple, when on
her shell-like feet fell the golden fringe of her tunic,
or when she lounged among Persian cushions, twirling
her collar of cameos and chatting with the wise men
and philosophers. She was beautiful when she stood
naked on the threshold of her <i>cella</i> in the street of
Suburra, under the rosin torchlight that blazed in the
night, slowly chanting her Campanian lay, while from
the Tiber came the refrains of the orgies. She was
beautiful, too, in her old house of the <i>Cité</i> behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Gothic windows, among the noisy students, when without
fear of the sergeants, they struck the oaken tables
with their pewter mugs. She was beautiful when she
leaned over the green cloth and coveted the gold of the
provincials; then she wore high-heels and had a small
waist and a large wig which shed its perfumed powder
on her shoulders, a rose over her ear and a patch on
her cheek. Fear not that she will ever return, for she
is dead, quite dead.”</p>

<p>Ten miles from town is situated the notorious
“Casino” which is trying to emulate Monte Carlo
with its glare, gold and girls. If you win anything
there, you are lucky to get back to town with it without
being murdered or robbed. Recently a young man,
who made a fortune over night here, disappeared, and
all they found of him was his leg. Not long ago a stark-naked
woman was found dead near the Casino. The
mystery has not yet been cleared up. At the gate
entrance of this palatial gambling-hell, I noticed
policemen taking the license number of every auto that
arrived, to keep track of the chauffeurs, many of whom
are crooks and cut-throats. If you do survive, and
reach Havana in safety, the size of your bill makes
you feel very “automobilious.” Sad but true, it is
easier to locate some of our United States diplomatic
officials at the Casino at night, than in their offices
during the day.</p>

<p>The Havana Oriental race-track has a bad name
even among sports. There was no exhibition of fine,
fast horses or fast time, simply a fast set who threw
the races to the bettors who gave the most graft.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Boozing, betting and profanity were the characteristics
of the human race at the horse-race. Yet foreign, literary,
dramatic and musical reviews are crowded out
of newspaper columns for daily ads. and write-ups on
the elevating amusement of the Casino and race-track.</p>

<p>One cannot make an inventory of paradise in
Havana without mentioning the carnival. At the
Malecon I watched the Señoritas throw kisses and confetti—the
confetti was six inches deep—and I wondered
how it would be cleared up till I remembered
the number of “rakes” there were on the boulvards.
The Cuban’s idea of heaven is an endless Mardi Gras
where he may throw star-dust confetti and waltz with
the angels. However, the Havana carnival lacks the
spontaneity and gayety of Nice, Venice and Martinique,
it being more of a fashion show.</p>

<p>The populace takes little note of time save in the
dance. All society, from A to Z, thronged the theatres
and club-houses where they revolved like automata on
a music-box. I witnessed one ball in a small hall where
six policemen were stationed to keep the dancers
within the bounds of decency.</p>

<p>Cuba has declared a moratorium, yet the people
are neither paying each other nor the United States,
and act as if sugar were up to 25 cents a pound. They
cry for financial aid, yet I witnessed a Sunday carnival
where $75,000 was foolishly thrown away like so much
confetti.</p>

<p>The Havana youth is a dissipated dude who
improves his mind by strutting and staring on the
piazzas, and accosting women with insulting looks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
words. With him cursing passes for rhetoric. His
time and money are well spent at race-track, cock-pit,
roulette table and the harlot’s house. He is familiar
with all liquors except the stimulating wine of progress.</p>

<p>God has made Cuba beautiful with her altar-like
mountains, smile of the sea, waving palms, fragrant
fruits and flowers and sweet cane-fields, but Satan has
entered this Eden and left his slimy trail. Cuba, “The
Pearl of the Antilles,” has been trampled under the
hoofs of human swine. Too often the C in Cuban character
stands for cupidity, carnality, crookedness,
cabals, charlatanism, “Caramba” cursing, and contempt
for Americans.</p>

<p>Lot left Sodom and was saved. As I sailed away
from Havana, I said with Solomon, “Vanity, vanity,
all is Havanaty.”</p>

<h3>The Garter</h3>

<p>Consider the garter. It toileth not; neither doth
it sin. It stretcheth far, yet giveth not. When comes
night it relaxeth, yet morn finds it willing and ready,
yea, happy to take, up its appointed task. It hath no
visible means of support; it upholds its end and other
things; it is the tie that binds. Without it our lives
would indeed be loose lived. It enters far into the
career of woman, yet, blows no horn about it. It hideth
modestly. Once off the shelf of a blatant shop it
retireth for life and man sees it no more.</p>

<p><b>Dear Uncle Billy</b>—While sitting in front of a
bath house at Hot Springs I fell asleep and soon
found myself swinging in a hammock in a shaded nook
of the dells of Wisconsin. Nearby sat a young lady
magnificently gowned in a low neck and short skirt
creation, with her feet on a sugar barrel reading to
me from the Whiz Bang. In the distance came a short,
fat man carrying two bottles of Hamm’s Export just
off the ice. I was about to reach for a bottle when the
heavy hand of Friend Mac touched me on the shoulder
and awakened me. What I want to know is, what
should I do to Mac for shaking me out of my dream
before the climax.—<b>Ham Spear.</b></p>

<p>Your story reminds me of some of my dreams in
the Islands, when someone would always awaken me
before the Colonel had time to hand me the discharge
papers I was dreaming about. I would suggest you
pour hot water on Mac next time he slumbers. He will
then dream of entering the gates of hell.</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="hide">“</span>Life is a jest and all things show it; I thought so
once but now I know it,” is Gay’s gloomy epitaph
in Westminster Abbey. Did he receive this impression
when he walked the streets of London? In his
poem, “Trivia,” he tells us how to walk the streets,
what to wear, the good people to address, the industrious
ones to encourage, and the bad folks to pass by.</p>

<p>Poe, in his “Man in the Crowd,” writes of the
mass of people, and of beggar, tramp and peddler; of
the modest, pretty girl; of the women of the town like
the statue in Lucian “with a surface of Parian marble
and with interior filled with filth”; and of a man who
walked all the crowded streets of London to get away
from himself.</p>

<p>De Quincy visits the Strand and says: “There one
feels like a single wave in the total Atlantic—like one
plant in the forest of America.” The loneliness of his
heart oppresses him among the crowd of unending
faces which have no friendly word for him, and he
stands “among hurrying figures of men weaving to and
fro, seeming like a masque of maniacs or a pageant of
phantoms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Stand on the corners, walk the streets of our own
big cities, the capitals of the Old World, or far-away
countries, and behold the extremes of work and idleness,
vice and virtue, sickness and health, innocent
mirth and mad amusement. The people follow each
other like the waves of a storm-tossed sea, and long
after you have returned to your room their walking,
talking, laughing and crying comes to you like the sad
moan of the sea trying to be at peace.</p>

<p>Nature is the place to study God in the book of
field, mountain and ocean. City streets are the place
to study man in the sham, struggle and sin of life.</p>

<p>In the afternoon and evening, work gives way to
play. All classes meet and mingle on the street; silk
and cotton, glove and hard hand, auto and carriage,
revel in a democracy of delight. It is as necessary and
natural to play as to work, and we must have rest,
recreation and rejoicing.</p>

<p>At night good people say an early “Good night,”
read their Bible, pray, put out the light, and snore.
The Devil begins just then to light his red lamp and
lead his votaries into paths that too often end in disease
of body, darkness of mind, and death of soul. Next
morning high society may hush up the disgrace and
infamy, but guilty hearts know their own bitterness
and that evening’s comedy has turned to morning’s
tragedy.</p>

<p>Cities resemble a Demon’s brain, and the women
of the night are its evil thoughts. There are too many
wantons with powdered face, brazen look and leering
laughter; too many giddy girls with bare necks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
shoulders, abbreviated skirts and hobbled feet walking
the streets.</p>

<p>If there were no girls,—but there are more girls
than boys, and necessarily for wives and mothers to fill
the vacancies caused by war, vice and death. If there
were no streets,—but streets are essential as arteries
of commerce, avenues of friendly meeting and public
parade.</p>

<p>Morning, noon and night we walk the street and
see dishonesty, impurity, poverty and disease,—old and
young jostling each other in seeming joy; but their tell-tale
faces speak of a heart with a secret grave of shame,
where they fear they may stumble over a ghastly
grinning skull that will mock their joy.</p>

<p>It will take more than Art Galleries, Symphony
Concerts, Parks, Vice Commissions and Grand Jury
reports to make the streets of city life clean and its
boys and girls good citizens. The cure for sin is not a
piece of court-plaster to cover over wrong, but the
Gospel of hand, head and heart that trains a child’s
soul, mind and will in the way he should go so that
when he is old his steps will not depart from it.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The merits and demerits of prohibition and the
lawful consumption of the grand old hootch of
the good old days have been subject to warm
debates as far back as history can be traced. Here’s
one from Hollinshed’s Chronicles of 1577:</p>

<div class="blockquote sans">

<p>We distinguisheth three sortes thereof—Simplex, Composita,
Perfectissima—Beying Moderately taken, sayeth he, it sloweth age,
it strengthen youth; it helpeth digestion; it cutteth fleume; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
abandoneth melancholie; it relisheth the taste; it lighteneth the
mynd; it quickeneth the spirites; it cureth the hydropsie; it healeth
the strangury; it pounceth the stone; it repelleth gravel; it puffeth
away ventositie; it kepyth and preserveth the bed from whyrlyng,
the eyes from dazelyng, the tongue from lispyng, the mouth from
snafflyng, the teethe from chatteryng, the throte from ratlyng, the
reason from stieflyng, the stomach from womblyng, the harte from
swellyng, the bellie from wirtchyng, the guts from rumblyng, the
hands from shiveryng, the sinoews from shrinkyng, the veynes from
crumplyng, the bones from akyng, the marrow from soakyng—and
trulie it is a sovereign liquor if it be orderlie taken.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott brought out the point that prohibition
is as intemperate as drunkenness, when he
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote sans">

<p>“Know, foolish Saracen,” replied the Christian without hesitation,
“that thou blasphemest the gifts of God....</p>

<p>“The juice of the grape is given to him that will use it wisely,
as that which cheers the heart of man after toil, refreshes him in
sickness and comforts him in sorrow. He who so enjoyeth it may
thank God for His wine cup as for His daily bread; and he who
abuseth the gift of Heaven is not a greater fool in his intoxication
than thou in thine abstinence.”</p>

</div>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Literary criticism is prone to make a great deal
of bother about something that nobody cares two
pins for, but sometimes, after the fabric of discussion
has been thoroughly masticated, literary criticism
does come down to bed rock and agree on one
point which is incontrovertible. Among the subjects
in which there is at present a universal agreement is
the declaration that the American short story is the
highest in perfection of any form of fiction that is put
out in the world. Even the French, artists as they are,
must take a back seat when it comes to the writing of
tales that are brief and effective.</p>

<p>It was the coruscating Ouida who emphasized the
fact that flowers of the most exquisite beauty have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
their origin in the backyard heaps—wonderful passion
blossoms bloom gorgeously in surroundings that are
the worst. The connection has never been established,
but the coincidence is indisputable, that the vaunted
American short story, so clean morally and so harmless
that the most modest virgin may read it without fear
of being corrupted, is modeled upon the naughty story,
conspicuously American in its construction, which
would paralyze with horror any virgin who should
happen to lend to its recital an attentive ear.</p>

<p>If one could but divest himself of his moral pulchritude,
what paeans of praise would be poured forth
in honor of that sinful and abhorrent thing, the naughty
story! It is so brilliant, so forceful, so perfectly filed
down and sharpened and polished until its edge is like
the edge of a Damascus blade and its point is finer than
a needle’s! Instinctively the teller of such a tale flings
aside every detail which is not absolutely essential to
the narrative. There is not a word too much. There
is not a trace of description which, could be dispensed
with. All—all is sacrificed to the exigency of brevity
and to the final effect.</p>

<h3>Baseball Extra</h3>

<p>The game opened with Molasses at the stick and
Smallpox catching. Cigar was in the box with plenty
of smoke. Horn played first base and Fiddle on second
base. Backed by Corn in the field made it hot for the
umpire. Apple, who was rotten. Axe came to bat and
chopped. Cigars let Brick walk and Sawdust filled the
bases. Song made a hit and Twenty scored. Cigar
went out and Balloon started to pitch, but went straight
up. Then Cherry tried, but went wild. Old Ice kept
cool in the game until he was hit by a pitched ball,
then you ought to have heard Ice scream. Cabbage
had a good head and kept quiet. Grass covered lots of
ground and the crowd cheered when Spider caught a
fly. Bread loafed on third base and bumped. Organ,
who played a fast game, put out Lightning. In the
fifth inning Wind began to blow what he could do.
Hammer began to knock and Trees began to leave. The
way they roasted Peanuts was a fright. Knife was put
out for cutting first base. Lightning finished pitching
and struck out six men. In the ninth Apple told Fiddle
to take first base and then Song made a hit. Trombone
made a slide and Meat was put out on the plate. There
was a lot of betting on the game. But Soap cleaned up.
The score was 1-0. Door said if he had pitched he
would have shut them out.</p>

<h2><i>Film Feast Fights</i></h2>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Ah! Now the dainty damsels of the screen have
the excitement for which their artistic temperaments
crave! For the edification of the filmland folk, Los
Angeles hotels have introduced the prize fight as a
dinner attraction, partly supplanting the dinner
dansant, and here we have diminutive Bebe Daniels
cavorting at one of these film fight feasts, rubbing
elbows with effete Kid McCoy, whose barefoot partner,
as Richmond states, put on her shoes and walked
out.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Society prize fights are the latest in Los Angeles
and Pasadena. The winter tourists, society people
and so on have fallen. Didn’t Anne Morgan set
the example in New York? Main dining rooms have
been turned into prize rings, where, during a lull in the
supper dance, the fighters, their seconds, water bottles,
cuspidors and other necessary adjuncts are led forth.</p>

<p>No, prizefighters don’t generally have cuspidors;
they generally spit in the water bucket or on the floor;
anyhow, they spit. They can’t help it.</p>

<p>The swell hotels of Pasadena and Los Angeles
already have staged their preliminary fistic functions.
There is no bunc about the fights, at least so far as
appearance and appurtenances are concerned. The
men wear regulation ring clothes and, as everyone
knows, this means they can’t wear much more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
most of the women present, who shriek with delight
and false alarm at the thud of brawny fists on hairy
breasts and bloody noses.</p>

<p>Whiz Bang is not long-haired, consequently can’t be
against a good boxing contest or a fight, whatever it is
they call them. But one may entertain an opinion that
some things were meant for men and if there is anything
a man is better fitted for, or can do better, than
women, for heaven’s sake let him do it.</p>

<p>The Alexandria-Alec, as it popularly is known,
initiated the fad in this burg. The society editors must
have been there for one thing, judging from elite galaxy
of names which appeared next day.</p>

<p>Kid McCoy also was there, appearing somewhat
better in his tux than most of the non-athletic looking
gentlemen present. The Kid emerged recently from
his ninth (or was it his fifteenth?) matrimonial experiment.
He married a dancer of the films, a bare-footed
one. But evidently she put on her shoes and walked
out.</p>

<p>The literary lights were somewhat in evidence.
Guy Price, Eddie Moriarity and H. M. Walker, with
the assumed or naturally bored air that seems to mark
the popular newspaper sporting writers, were taking
in the innovation or being innovated in the taking in,
whichever it was. Moriarity and Walker said who won
the fights and from their dour looks one would never
judge they write funny titles for Semon and Lloyd.</p>

<p>Tom Mix jumped into the ring as referee. Those
who watched paid well for it. But there was dinner,
of course, and a dance, thrown in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Bebe Daniels was one of the first on the floor. Not
that Bebe seemed overly excited about it. But the
proud looking young man who trotted her out seemed
not without fear that his appearance with the fair Bebe
might be overlooked if he didn’t get an early start upon
the ball room boards.</p>

<p>But Bebe was worth looking at; incidentally, one
of the few modest looking women on the floor. They
say she is stuck up. They say that about most of the
really stellar female attractions of the screen. But the
insider opines that Bebe’s bored look combines a sense
of humor and the common sense of a young girl who
finds that the glitter and night adulation are mostly
18 carat bunc. Yet Bebe danced and danced.</p>

<p>As we have said before, society doesn’t know what
to do about the picture stars, especially if they are
starettes. But to miss seeing them, so one can talk
about what they wore and whom they were with, that
would be ultra ignoramus, as one might aptly say.
Just what a bunch of supposedly high bred society
women, Miss Morgan to the contrary, can see in the
spectacle of two men slamming each other around the
ring passeth, no doubt, some portion of the male element.</p>

<p>Sounds like we are getting sermony. Far be it
from us. There are worse things than women in evening
garb gushing over mostly naked men fighting in
the main dining room of our swell hotels.</p>

<p>One thing about Mary and Doug.; they are fairly
exclusive. Some of the younger stars might do well to
emulate them. Yet, perhaps before a star becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
luminous planet it must do its sparkle; cast its lesser
light, until the fact that it does not glow at every gay
party can cause more comment than the mere presence,
thereat, would cause.</p>

<p>Mary and Doug. are becoming more talked of
because they stay home than because they step out. Of
course, Mary and Doug. have something to chat of
among themselves again, now that Nevada is talking
marriage annulment again.</p>

<p>We still remain firm in our predictions of months
ago that Nevada has more talk than annulment in her
system, so far as the Fairbanks family is concerned.</p>

<h3>He Led in Prayer</h3>

<p>An old railroad man was converted, as the story
goes, and was asked to lead in prayer. Here is the
way he worked it: “Oh, Lord, now that I have flagged
Thee, lift my feet off the rough road of life and plant
them safely on the deck of the train of salvation. Let
me use the safety lamp known as prudence; make all
couplings in the train with the strong link of Thy
love. And, Heavenly Father, keep all switches closed
that lead off to sidings, especially those with a blind
end. Oh, Lord, if it be Thy pleasure, have every semaphore
block along the line show the white line of hope,
that I may make the run of life without stopping.
And, Lord, give us the Ten Commandments as a schedule
time, and when my train shall have pulled into
the great, dark station of Death, may Thou, the Superintendent
of the Universe, say with a smile: ‘Well
done, thou good and faithful servant; come up and
sign the payroll and receive your check for eternal
happiness.’”</p>

<h2><i>It Pays to Advertise</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY OXNARD PETE</p>

<p class="dropcap">It isn’t necessary to read magazine stories any more.
The editor tells you all about them in “eye catchers”
at the beginning. They read like this:</p>

<p>“<i>Mary’s Garter</i>,” by R. Ubberneck. A snappy and
re-elastic love story that stretches the imagination to
the breaking point. No “honi soit” stuff here.</p>

<p>“<i>100 to 1</i>,” by N. O. Chance. A race track story.
Like a gambler’s watch chain, it has a “charm” that
holds the eye.</p>

<p>“<i>Frozen Tears</i>,” by P. North Poole. Returning,
after years spent in the far north, John Snow’s wife
gives him a cold welcome. He finds that Eskimo maidens
may have cold feet, but warm hearts. A tale of
polar bears, whale blubber, seal blubber and plain blubber.</p>

<p>Don’t fail to read “<i>Way Down Yeast</i>,” by Holmes
Brewer, in our next issue. Mr. Brewer’s stories are as
funny as a barrel of monkey wrenches; his wit as spontaneous
as a fire sale in Goldstein’s clothing store.
And as unique as a drink of real whiskey.</p>

<p>“<i>Down in the Deep</i>,” by Professor U. Drinkwater.
A scientific article on the peculiarities of the Zoanatharia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
actina, mesembryanthemum, tealia crassicornis and
other anemones. Too deep for any one but a highbrow
to wade through.</p>

<p>“<i>Lucy’s Looseness</i>,” by E. Strong Onion. A story
with a smile, some tears, and seeming to breathe
throughout, the fragrance of old Bermuda.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
